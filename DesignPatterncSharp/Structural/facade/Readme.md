- A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts.
	A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem directly.
    However, it includes only those features that clients really care about.
- Adapter does not create a new interface but facade creates new interface. Adapter straight forward works with library,
	Facade couples multiple subsystem method into single method and provides you with simple method
- Controller metod calling a service method , which interacts with multiple subsystem can be consideres as facade pattern also.
