- Proxy pattern also wraps around the original object like decorator pattern.
- Proxy pattern uses the same interface while the decorator pattern uses the enhanced interface 
	(enhanced interface does not mean new interface its about adding extra functionality with the decorator implementation )
- Consumer can directly access the original object in decorator pattern where as in proxy the consumer cannot access the original object
- decorator pattern modifies the original behaviour of object where as proxy pattern does nopt modifty the original object
- Proxty pattern is mainly used for seurity, access control and performance
- Decorator pattern can modify the behaviour at the runtime where as thr proxy cannot modify it at runtime and only follows the control flow written in proxy method.
- Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.
