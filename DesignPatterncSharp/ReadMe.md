There are three types of design patterns

#Creational
#Structural
#Behavioural

#Creational:

		This type deals with object creation and initialization.This pattern gives more flexibility in deciding which 
		object need to be created for given case.
				Eg: Singleton,Factory,Abstract Factory etc...

#Structural:
		
		This type deals with class and object composition.This pattern focuses on decoupling interfaces and
		implementation of classes and objects.
				Eg: Adapter,Bridge etc...

#Behavioural:
		
		This type deals with communication between classes and objects.
				Eg: Chain of responsibility,Command,Interpreter etc...
